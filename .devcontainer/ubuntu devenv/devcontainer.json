// The Ubuntu-based devenv is lighter tested than the Fedora based one.
// But in combination with microsoft's stuff, including GitHub codespaces, it's the best performant option. Probably.
//
// That said, you'll have the problem with docker vs. podman. That's yours to deal with. :P (just replace podman in the local devel prep task and most cases should be fine)
