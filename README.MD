# Lumina(/peonies) server

Warning ya -- Lumina stores in `$HOME/.luminainstance` unless specified as argument. If you'd like to keep it in the
workspace, use:

```bash
cargo run -- ./test
```

You'll need `PNPM/Bun/NPM` on `Bun/NodeJS` and the stable Rust Toolchain for that (those are in order of preference.).
