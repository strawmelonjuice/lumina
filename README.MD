# Lumina(/peonies) server

## Requirements
- [The Gleam compiler, `Erlang` and `rebar3`](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/)
- A `MySQL`/`MariaDB` database (or a SQLite one if you want to be QD!)
- The [Bun](https://bun.sh/) TypeScript ecosystem

## Running Lumina

#### Clone it!

```shell
git clone https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/lumina.git
```

#### Run it!

Warning ya -- Lumina loads and logs in `$HOME/.luminainstance/` unless specified otherwise as argument. If you'd like to keep it in the
workspace, use:

```bash
bun run dev start-in ./
```

otherwise, just use `bun run dev` or `bun run build && gleam start` and have Lumina start in its default.


### Environment variables

Part of the configuration is loaded from the MySQL database, part of it in environment variables.
Environment variables can be set in the _environment_ before run, but Lumina prefers them to be loaded from `$LUMINAFOLDER/.env`.
