# Why

This file aims to explain my choices. Not that I need to explain myself
but hey, we all feel accountable for our stupid actions sometimes.

## The `rsffi` Rust NIF library

I am just very attached to the love of my life Rust. And I think
the Rust way of doing things might come in handy somewhere down the road.
Plus, on JavaScript, FFI'ing is fairly easy, I almost write more JS/TS in my
life than Rust and Gleam...
Erlang on the other hand is kind of a scary thing. Rust is comfy! ðŸ¥°
