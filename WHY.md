## The `rsffi` Rust NIF library

I am just very attached to the love of my life Rust. And I think
the Rust way of doing things might come in handy somewhere down the road.
Plus, on JavaScript, FFI'ing is fairly easy, I almost write more JS/TS in my
life than Rust and Gleam...
Erlang on the other hand is kind of a scary thing. Rust is comfy! ðŸ¥°

### Markdown to HTML rendering in Rust instead of natively in Gleam

I think it's a good idea to have a Rust NIF for rendering markdown to HTML.
I've had it work with `kirala` (Gleam), but I think it's a good idea to have
the kind of control over it that I had in the pure Rust version.

## The `gleam` language

I am a big fan of the language. I think it's a great language for
writing maintainable and scalable code. I think it's a great language
for writing maintainable and scalable code. It's simplicity and the
young yet strong community set a good foundation for Lumina.
