//// Welcome to the timestamp module! This module and its `Timestamp` type are
//// what you will be using most commonly when working with time in Gleam.
////
//// A timestamp represents a moment in time, represented as an amount of time
//// since the calendar time 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, also known as the
//// _Unix epoch_.
////
//// # Wall clock time and monotonicity
////
//// Time is very complicated, especially on computers! While they generally do
//// a good job of keeping track of what the time is, computers can get
//// out-of-sync and start to report a time that is too late or too early. Most
//// computers use "network time protocol" to tell each other what they think
//// the time is, and computers that realise they are running too fast or too
//// slow will adjust their clock to correct it. When this happens it can seem
//// to your program that the current time has changed, and it may have even
//// jumped backwards in time!
////
//// This measure of time is called _wall clock time_, and it is what people
//// commonly think of when they think of time. It is important to be aware that
//// it can go backwards, and your program must not rely on it only ever going
//// forwards at a steady rate. For example, for tracking what order events happen
//// in. 
////
//// This module uses wall clock time. If your program needs time values to always
//// increase you will need a _monotonic_ time instead. It's uncommon that you
//// would need monotonic time, one example might be if you're making a
//// benchmarking framework.
////
//// The exact way that time works will depend on what runtime you use. The
//// Erlang documentation on time has a lot of detail about time generally as well
//// as how it works on the BEAM, it is worth reading.
//// <https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction>.
////
//// # Converting to local calendar time
////
//// Timestamps don't take into account time zones, so a moment in time will
//// have the same timestamp value regardless of where you are in the world. To
//// convert them to local time you will need to know the offset for the time
//// zone you wish to use, likely from a time zone database. See the
//// `gleam/time/calendar` module for more information.

/// - Users typically want dates formatted according to their local time zone.

///   zone? What are we supposed to do with it then?
/// - Despite it being useless (or worse, a source of bugs), the UTC offset

/// It may at first seem that the RFC 3339 format includes timezone

/// reasons:
///
/// - RFC 3339's timestamp format is based on calendar time, but it is
///   unambigous, so it can be converted into epoch time when being parsed. It
///   is always better to internally use epoch time to represent unambiguous
///   points in time, so we perform that conversion as a convenience and to
///   ensure that programmers with less time experience don't accidentally use
///   a less suitable time representation.
///
/// - RFC 3339's contains _calendar time offset_ information, not time zone
///   information. This is enough to convert it to an unambiguous timestamp,
///   but it is not enough information to reliably work with calendar time.
///   Without the time zone and the time zone database it's not possible to
///   know what time period that offset is valid for, so it cannot be used
///   without risk of bugs.
///
/// ## Behaviour details
/// 
/// - Follows the grammar specified in section 5.6 Internet Date/Time Format of 
///   RFC 3339 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6>.
/// - The `T` and `Z` characters may alternatively be lower case `t` or `z`, 
///   respectively.
/// - Full dates and full times must be separated by `T` or `t`. A space is also 
///   permitted.
/// - Leap seconds rules are not considered.  That is, any timestamp may 
///   specify digts `00` - `60` for the seconds.
/// - Any part of a fractional second that cannot be represented in the 
///   nanosecond precision is tructated.  That is, for the time string, 
///   `"1970-01-01T00:00:00.1234567899Z"`, the fractional second `.1234567899` 
///   will be represented as `123_456_789` in the `Timestamp`.
